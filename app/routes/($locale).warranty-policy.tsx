          The <strong>Obligation of APP</strong> is to warrant all products
          purchased from APP to be free from manufacturing defects and material
          defects, provided they have been correctly installed and used as
          intended by design. Coverage is for a period of 12 months and is
          limited to repair, replacement, or customer credit for the Performance

        <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 text-gray-700 mb-4">
          <li>
            All warranty claims must be accompanied by completed APP official
            documentation, available to download from the website, and should
            include the original purchase invoice. All claims must be submitted
            to the entity through which the product was originally purchased.
          </li>
          <li>
            In cases where claims are accepted, credit or replacement parts will
            be applied within 30 days of acceptance confirmation. If replacement
            parts are required before the warranty parts are returned to APP,
            the customer will be charged for the replacement parts. Credit will
            be issued only after the parts are received and assessed by APP.
          </li>
          <li>
            The complete clutch kit must be returned as supplied. If a flywheel
            has not been purchased, photographic evidence of the vehicle’s
            flywheel will be required upon submission.
          </li>
          <li>
            Carriage cost for the return of products to APP is at the customer’s
            expense. In cases of claim acceptance, APP will reimburse the cost
            of return, provided an official invoice is submitted at the time of
            return. Products associated with accepted claims will not be
            returned to the customer. Collection from APP of rejected warranty
            claims is also at the customer’s expense. Products will be retained
            for a period of 30 days before disposal following the completion of
            the warranty report.
