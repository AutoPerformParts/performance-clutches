              What is a DMF kit?
            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              The DMF kit (Dual Mass Flywheel) is a performance clutch kit
              designed to be used in conjunction with the factory-fit Dual Mass
              Flywheel. The DMF comprises two halves, retaining many of the
              driving characteristics when the Performance Clutches kit is
              installed.

              How does the Performance Clutches DMF kit drive compared to the
              original clutch fitted?
            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              As the clutch kit is bolted directly to the vehicles Dual Mass
              Flywheel, it retains the progressive engagement feel of the
              original, especially with the Stage 1 Organic and Stage 1 Street
              HD kits. The Ceramic friction kits will have a less progressive
              engagement due to the harder compound material.

              This is entirely based on vehicle applications. In most cases, the

            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              This depends on the application. Certain vehicles were fitted with
              either a LuK or Sachs kit, which are not interchangeable. In these
              cases, the engine code is required for identification, and the
              application guide will state which flywheel variant the clutch is
              suitable for.

              Will I need to replace my Dual Mass Flywheel when fitting a new

            <p className="text-gray-700">
              The Dual Mass Flywheel is subject to the same degree of wear as
              the clutch. Therefore, its operational condition should always be
              checked against the manufacturer’s tolerance before a new
              Performance Clutches kit is installed.

              It is recommended to perform 500 miles of stop-start driving to
              break in the friction materials and maximize the clutch’s
              performance and longevity. This is particularly important for
              clutches that use Ceramic friction material.

              No, the original manufacturer’s certified bolts can be used to

              If your vehicle uses a conventional release bearing, this will be
              included within the Performance Clutches DMF kit. If your vehicle
              uses a hydraulic Concentric Slave Cylinder, this is not included,
              as these units can be manufactured in either plastic or metal, and
              the choice is a personal preference. It is recommended, however,
              to replace the cylinder with one provided by an original equipment
              manufacturer.
